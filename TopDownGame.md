## Top Down Game

This is a personal project that I've been developing in Unreal Engine with C++ & Blueprints.
It's an Action Role-Playing Game, akin to Diablo & PoE with a faked Isometric view.
The game is in its early stages, however the systems are robust and modular, with a large scope.
This is a pure passion project, to fill a void left in me after finishing Divinity: Original Sin 2 which is quite possible my favourite game of all time.
This game will be less Dungeons and Dragons and more Diablo, I guess like the classic Beyond Divinity.
Randomised loot, abilities & skill trees, quests and a vast world. It's a huge project, but I'm taking it slow, I'm proud of what I've worked on so far and the quality of the code produced.
Here's a sneak peak...
