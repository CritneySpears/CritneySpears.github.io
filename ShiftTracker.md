## Shift Tracker



This is a mobile app developed in Xamarin that I made so that I could track my hours accurately when working at a hotel.
Simply just clock in & out and you can view your times and total hours worked for the period.
If you forget to clock either in or out, then you can edit a shift manually.

Here's a youtube video showing the latest build...
