This was a game jam project made in Unreal Engine with a few other students over a weekend in spring 2021.
The theme of the jam was "Super" so we decided to take a simple run through a level scenario and layer it up with bizarre mechanics and visuals.
The player can change the colours they see, which hides and unhides different obstacles.
The player can also throw fruit at gnomes. The aim of the game is to deliver all fruit to gnomes whilst getting to the end of the level as fast as possible.
It was a fun and challenging 48 hours, and some of the ideas with the colour changing obstacles could make for a fun mechanic in another project!

Here's a youtube video showing the latest build...
