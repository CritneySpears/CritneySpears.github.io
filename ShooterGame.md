My submission for Game Behaviour. This is a demonstration of advanced use of destruction physics & AI behaviour trees.
The Game starts the character with a compound in view. The aim is to clear the compound, find an item and then defend against 10 waves of enemies.
The player can shoot, melee, throw grenades and call in airstrikes being careful not to destroy all of their cover for the AI to exploit.

Here's a youtube video showing the latest build...
