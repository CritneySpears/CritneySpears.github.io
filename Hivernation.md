## Hivernation



This is my final year game development project. As part of a team, we must design, develop and implement a game from a given "unusual" prompt. 

We chose city builder + survival

So we made a bee-themed RTS akin to Northgard & the Stronghold Crusader series.

Here's a youtube video showing the latest build...
